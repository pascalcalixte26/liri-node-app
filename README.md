# liri-node-app

The purpose of this app is to show the full capabilities of pulling data via API requests

It also shows the full power of using Switch commands when incorporated into an app.  

Four commands were implemented although 2 relied on the Spotify API which required a token which I wasn't able to nail down.

Another command required the Bands in Town api which required I be an artist to request and the bootcamp api wasn't active to my knowledge

All in all, I was able to get the commands to update to the log.txt file with the exceptiion of the read file from random.txt tile.
